			<![CDATA[Can eating a poppy-seed bagel cause you to fail a drug test?]]>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<![CDATA[Yes. Of the 90 or so species of poppy, one, Papaver somniferum, is commonly used for two things: drugs and food. The amount of morphine and codeine in poppy seeds varies enormously. Largely because of the poppy seed problem, the federal test threshold for morphine and codeine will probably be raised from 300 nanograms per millileter to 2,000.]]>

			<![CDATA[What are some interesting facts about London taxicabs?]]>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<![CDATA[The black taxicab is a familiar feature of the London scene. The cabs and their drivers, the London cabbies, are products of a system of licensing that extends back to 1639. About 1900 there were more than 11,000 registered cabs for hire on the streets of London, and double that number a century later. Motorized cabs first made their appearance in 1904 and soon displaced the horse-drawn cab (the last survived until 1947). A regulation of 1906 required the new mechanical cabs to be designed in such a way that they could turn, like the two-wheeled hansom cab, in a circle of at most 25 feet. Still in force, it accounts for the surprising maneuverability of black cabs in congested London streets and their distinctive "sit up and beg" design. Cabbies themselves are subjected to even older regulations, which require them to pass a detailed test on topography, street names, and principal destinations throughout a six-mile radius from Charing Cross. Trainee taxi drivers acquiring "the knowledge," as it is called, are a familiar sight on the streets of the capital.]]>

		</question>
		<answer>
			<![CDATA[Reynold Johnson (1906-1998) invented a device for scoring test forms marked with a pencil while he was a science teacher during the Depression. He went on to I.B.M., where he became the father of the computer disk drive and developed the RAMAC 305, a machine that revolutionized the way 1s and 0s are magnetically stored. In 1956, the RAMAC disk drive held only five megabytes of data -- on 50 large plates with a combined weight of one ton!]]>

			<![CDATA[At what IQ level is a person considered a genius?]]>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<![CDATA[The term "IQ score" is widely used but poorly defined. There are a large number of tests with different scales. The result on one test of 132 can be the same as a score 148 on another test. Some intelligence tests don't use IQ scores at all. I.Q. tests are probably accurate in apprehending genius under certain conditions, but other manifestations of genius are now being accepted as intrinsically valuable as part of the genius continuum.]]>

			<![CDATA[How long after intercourse does it take to find out if you are pregnant?]]>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<![CDATA[Tests for pregnancy are based on the detection of the hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which is produced by the developing placenta and prevents menstruation and the termination of the pregnancy. The body begins to produce hCG when the fertilized egg implants in the uterus. The hormone is secreted into the pregnant woman's blood and is excreted in her urine; it can be detected in either of these fluids by immunoassay, which is a method of quantifying a chemical substance by means of an antigen-antibody reaction. This type of pregnancy test can be carried out as early as several days before the woman's first missed period. False results do occur, with false-negative results being more common than false positives, especially if the test is performed early in the pregnancy, before a sufficient amount of hCG is in the urine. Over-the-counter pregnancy tests are available for home use; however, they yield a higher incidence of false results than do laboratory tests. The most reliable method of detection is a radioimmunoassay of the woman's blood, which can establish pregnancy within a few days of conception. The fertilization of an ovum (egg) by a spermatozoan usually occurs in one of the two fallopian tubes. As the fertilized egg, or zygote, moves down the tube toward the uterus, it undergoes repeated cell divisions. After several days, it consists of a ball of about 100 cells called a blastocyst, which differentiates into an inner group of cells that become the embryo and an outer ring of cells (the trophoblast) that becomes part of the placenta. About the seventh day after fertilization, the trophoblast implants in the uterine wall. The trophoblast invades the uterine lining, forming fingerlike projections that are surrounded by maternal blood vessels. This combination of trophoblastic and maternal tissue is the placenta. The home pregnancy tests offer different timing for taking the test. Consult with a pharmacist or your gynecologist for the test that could be taken most immediately.]]>

			<![CDATA[Can one tell what flavor Kool-aid one is drinking when blindfolded?]]>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<![CDATA[When you cannot smell food, it has little taste. The feel and texture give you some clues about the food you are eating. Not seeing it does make it a little harder, but it is the other senses of smell, feel, and taste that tell you the most about food or drink. To prove the importance of your nose for tasting, try to identify some different foods with your tongue alone. Samples of food with similar textures, for example: raw potato, turnip, apple, and onion cooked peas and baked beans different flavors of jelly different types of cheese You'll also need: handkerchief a friend Have your friend prepare samples of the foods you are testing. Make sure each sample is about the same size and shape. Tie on the handkerchief as a blindfold, hold your nose tightly, and put out your tongue. Have your friend place a sample of food on your tongue. Say what you think the food is. Now bite the sample. Repeat the test with each sample of food. When the test is complete, your friend will tell you how often you were correct.]]>

			<![CDATA[What are the requirements for joining MENSA?]]>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<![CDATA[Membership in Mensa is open to persons who have attained a score within the upper two percent of the general population on an approved intelligence test that has been properly administered and supervised. There is no other qualification or disqualification for membership eligibility. The term "IQ score" is widely used but poorly defined. There are a large number of tests with different scales. The result on one test of 132 can be the same as a score 148 on another test. Some intelligence tests don't use IQ scores at all. Mensa has set a percentage as cutoff to avoid this confusion. Candidates for membership in Mensa must achieve a score at or above the 98th percentile (a score that is greater or equal than 98 percent of the general population taking the test) on a standard test of intelligence. Generally, there are two ways to prove that you qualify for Mensa: either take the Mensa test, or submit a qualifying test score from another test. There are a large number of intelligence tests that are "approved". More information on whether a test you have done is approved, as well as information on the procedure for taking the Mensa test, can be obtained from the nearest Mensa office. There are no on-line tests that can be used for admission to Mensa. Feel free to contact Mensa for specific details about eligibility. Mensa has no other eligibility requirements other than IQ testing. However, many tests are not valid for people under the age of 16. You should contact the nearest Mensa office for more information. The word "Mensa" means "table" in Latin. The name stands for a round-table society, where race, color, creed, national origin, age, politics, educational or social background are irrelevant.]]>

			<![CDATA[What is meant by blood SED rate?]]>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<![CDATA[The ESR or SED rate is the rate that red blood cells settle out of unclotted blood in one hour. The SED rate is a timed test and the rate is given in mm/hr. There are different methods of obtaining the SED rate--such as Westergren, Cutler, Wintrobe, and Smith--and what is considered normal will depend on the method used. An inflammatory process causes an alteration in blood proteins and results in a clumping of red cells that causes them to fall rapidly when placed in a special container. The SED is important because increased levels may indicate infection, inflammatory diseases, carcinoma, toxemia, syphilis, severe anemia, nephritis, cell or tissue destruction, as well as other causes.]]>

			<![CDATA[Who has the world's highest I.Q. and what is it?]]>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<![CDATA[The test is scored in terms of intelligence quotient, or IQ, a concept first suggested by German psychologist William Stern and adopted by Lewis Terman in the Stanford-Binet Scale. The IQ was originally computed as the ratio of a person's mental age to his chronological (physical) age, multiplied by 100. Thus, if a child of 10 had a mental age of 12 (that is, performed on the test at the level of an average 12-year-old), then the child was assigned an IQ of (12/10) X 100, or 120. A score of 100, for which the mental age equaled the chronological age, was average; scores above 100 were above average, scores below 100 were below average. The concept of mental age has fallen into disrepute, however, and few tests now involve the computation of mental ages. Yet many tests still yield an IQ; this figure is now computed on the basis of the statistical percentage of people who are expected to have a certain IQ. Intelligence test scores follow an approximately "normal" distribution, with most people scoring near the middle of the distribution curve and scores dropping off fairly rapidly in frequency away from the curve's centre. For example, on the IQ scale about 2 out of 3 scores fall between 85 and 115 and about 19 out of 20 scores fall between 70 and 130. A score of about 130 or above is considered gifted, while a score below about 70 is considered mentally deficient or retarded.]]>

			<![CDATA[How does one see if ice is thick enough to skate on?]]>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<![CDATA[The only sure way to check the ice thickness is by having an adult cut a hole in the ice and measure. A hatchet, saw or auger can be used to cut through the ice. As a further test, an adult should walk onto the ice, carrying a ladder or pole. The ice should not shift or crack. <br /> <br /> If you skate on a lake or pond, take these additional safety precautions: <br /> <br /> * Do not skate unless the ice has a uniform thickness of at least 4-6 inches (some even advise 8-inch thickness!) <br /> * Have rescue devices, such as a rope, ladder and blankets handy <br /> * Do not skate alone <br /> <br /> <br /> Should the ice begin to shift or crack, the person should lie down and carefully roll or crawl to shore. <br /> <br /> Remember, just because the ice is thick enough in one spot does not mean it will be as thick in another. <br /> <br /> The ice will be thinner where there are undercurrents, and weak where there are pressure holes and ridges. <br /> <br /> Whether you skate on an outdoor pond or at an indoor rink, keep safety in mind and use equipment that fits well. Skates that are too loose can make it difficult to keep your balance. If they are too tight, they can interfere with circulation.]]>
